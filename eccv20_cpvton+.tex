\begin{abstract}

Recently, image-based virtual try-on (VTON) with a try-on cloth and a target human image has drawn increasing attraction for online apparel shopping. The previous algorithms use 2 step approach: first, it warps the try-on cloth to align with the pose and shape of the target human, and then blends the warped cloth with the target human image. In spite of successful demonstration of the previous work with sample dataset, the successful operating condition for algorithms has not yet studied. In this paper, we conduct an detailed performance study with carefully classified cloth style and human pose and shape. This study reveals that the image-based VTON algorithms has a limited working condition, mistakes in the used dataset such as  improper human segmentation labelling, misunderstanding in user demands such as not retaining non-targeted cloth, unsatisfactory warping network performance and the optimization cost function. Accordingly, we proposed a new image-based algorithm  tacking the observed issues, named CP-VTON+. CP-VTON+ proves  the observed issues right, by showing consistent improvements in SSIM, LPIPS, and IS over the previous ones.

\section{Conclusions}

Almost all real computer vision algorithms have a certain condition where they work successfully and not. Therefore it is more important than merely developing better algorithms to identify the working condition of algorithms and approaches.  By categorized cloth and human inputs and analysis not only final try-on results but also intermediate results of the pipeline, e.g. the warped cloth, we showed the key successful and unsuccessful conditions and origins of a typical image-based VTON algorithm, CP-VTON. 

With these identified issues, a CP-VTON+, an improvement to CP-VTON was proposed, which produces significant quality improvements over existing state-of-the-art algorithm, CP-VTON. 

However, there remains several areas that we could not yet solved. The automatic warping to the target human shape is still challenging in feature point search and matching and limitation of non-rigid 2-D transforms, and the accuracy human parsing  needs to be improved.
